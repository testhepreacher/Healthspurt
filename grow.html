        <h2>6 reasons why your natural African hair is not growing.</h2>
        <p>
          African hair is known for its curly kinky nature and its beautiful
          shine. However, a lot of black women struggle with growing their
          natural hair. You are probably reading this because you are one of
          them.
          <br />
          <br />
          In this post, I will be breaking down to you mistakes you are making
          in your hair growth regimen and what you should be doing instead.
          Let's go, shall we? <br />
          <br />
          <strong> You don't know your hair type </strong><br />
          <br />
          There are different gradings of hair type but the major black hair
          types are 4A, 4B, and 4C. These hair types become more curly and thick
          incrementally. 4A has S-shaped curls, 4b has zig-zagged shaped curls
          and 4c has thick coils. Typically people have a combination of these
          hair types, not just one.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-1.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          It is important to know your hair type to know the appropriate type of
          hair products and hair care regimen needed specifically for it. This
          is why someone can recommend a hair product that works perfectly for
          their hair, then you use it and don't see the changes you want. <br />
          <br />
          That product is simply suitable for their hair type and not yours.
          Know what your hair type is sis! <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Lack of moisture</strong> <br />
          <br />
          This is the singular fatal mistake a lot of women make that causes so
          much hair breakage and shedding.
          <br />
          <br />
          You see, natural African hair is prone to breakage because of its
          thick and frizzy nature. You need to moisturize it to protect your
          strands from unnecessary breakage.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Moisture translates to water. Natural hair does not thrive when dry so
          you need to get your hair all moisturized, plump, and healthy. I also
          do not mean dripping wet. Just enough moisture. <br />
          <br />
          Now to moisturize hair you need to know what porosity type your hair
          is which brings us back to the first point of knowing your hair type.
          This is extremely important. <br />
          <br />
          Porosity simply means the rate at which water penetrates your hair and
          scalp and also the rate at which it evaporates from your hair and
          scalp. <br />
          <br />
          People with low porosity hair typically have tighter pores on their
          scalps and hair pores which prevents water from easily entering them.
          The most obvious sign of low porosity hair is water bouncing off the
          hair at first when you try to wet it. Eventually, the hair strands do
          get moisturized and it takes a longer time for it to become dry.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the other hand, people with high porosity hair have wider pores
          that easily absorb water but just as easily get rid of it causing
          their hair to dry out faster. Then we have people with normal porosity
          that is in between the two. <br />
          <br />
          Take this little test now to find out your hair porosity
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-3.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          To moisturize your hair you will need a spray bottle. Mix some water
          with a leave-in conditioner and spray all through your hair till it
          becomes wet enough. If you do not have a spray bottle, using your
          hands to directly wet your hair with water and then using some
          Leave-in conditioner is also just fine. A spray bottle is just less
          messy. <br />
          <br />
          How often you moisturize your hair is up to your perception of when
          your hair is dry. There is no "one size fits all". <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Not using oils</strong> <br />
          properly Do not slather oil on your dry hair. Do not do it. The
          purpose of oils is to SEAL IN moisture. When you pour oil into water,
          what happens? It floats and forms a coat on the surface of the water,
          doesn't it? <br />
          <br />
          The same thing applies to your hair. You moisturize it first, only
          then do you apply oil to seal in all that moisture and prevent it from
          evaporating, keeping it all juicy and moisturized for a longer time.
          Understand? <br />
          <br />
          Now let's get into the type of oils. There are
          moisturizing/penetrating oils and protecting oils. <br />
          The most common penetrating oils are coconut oil, avocado oil, and
          olive oil. Penetrating oils are not most suitable for use after
          moisturizing your hair. I'll talk more about them as we proceed.
          <br />
          <br />
          Protecting oils on the other hand form a film over moisture. They are
          more suitable for sealing in moisture. There are a lot of protecting
          oils and I am sure you probably already use one of them. They include;
          castor oil, shea butter, jojoba oil, sunflower oil, and grape seed
          oil, essential oils like rosemary and tea tree oil. Make sure to
          dilute the essential oil with another oil before usage because they
          are very concentrated.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-4.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          If you have low-porosity hair, these protective oils are just perfect
          for sealing in moisture in your hair. If you have high porosity hair,
          heavy hair creams like hair grease and blue magic will be more
          suitable. Do you know those hair creams that are thick? Yes, those are
          the ones I'm talking about. They help tighten those open pores thereby
          retaining moisture for longer.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-5.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Using thick hair creams on low-porosity hair will clog the already
          tight pores which will retard hair growth. On the flip side,
          protective oils might not be enough to seal in moisture in
          high-porosity hair so you need something with a thicker consistency,
          hence the hair creams. <br />
          <br />
          So you see, it will be counterproductive for these two categories of
          people to have the same moisturizing routine, won't it? <br />
          <br />
          Now we've established moisturizing and then sealing in the moisture
          with oils let's move on to the next mistake you might be making which
          is retarding your hair growth. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Hygral fatigue</strong> <br />
          As much as your hair loves water and needs it to thrive, too much
          water can also harm it. As the saying goes, too much of everything is
          bad. <br />
          <br />
          An overload of water on your hair weakens your hair strands and will
          eventually cause breakage you see. This is called hygral fatigue.
          <br />
          <br />

          Hygral fatigue mostly occurs on your wash days which makes sense
          because it is when your hair gets exposed to the most amount of water
          right?
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-6.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Does that mean you shouldn't wash your hair? Of course not. There is
          just a better way to go about it which brings me back to penetrating
          oils. <br />
          <br />
          Penetrating oils also lock in moisture in your hair but more
          importantly, they prevent much water from entering the hair shaft
          which can damage the hair cuticle. <br />
          <br />
          The technique is as simple as this, you apply some penetrating oil
          like coconut or olive oil to your scalp and hair 6hrs or a day before
          washing and let it settle. This is called pre-pooing short for
          pre-shampooing.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-7.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Then, you wash your hair as usual and see the magic yourself. Your
          hair strands will be luscious and strong as opposed to that usual
          shrunken and snappy feel after a hair wash. Coconut oil serves as a
          check for hygral fatigue but your hair will still come out nice and
          clean and ready to go. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Leaving your hair out for too long</strong> <br />
          Now, this is another hair growth no-no and you can probably guess why.
          <br />
          <br />
          Like I said before natural African hair is tender and fragile and
          requires to be treated with love, care, and affection, just like you
          would like to be treated. Of course, you should flaunt your lovely
          kinky hair and just revel in its beauty from time to time. However,
          your hair should not be exposed to the environment for too long.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-8.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Solution? Simple. Protective hairstyles are the way to go. You want
          your hair made nicely and tucked away from direct exposure to harsh
          weather. Whether you use hair extensions or not is up to you. Just
          make your hair. Nobody likes that shrunken and messy look that comes
          with natural hair that hasn't been made in a while.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/afrik-9.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          You might be thinking, "but I take care of my hair when it's not made
          tho". That "taking care", the combing, the laying of edges, all of
          that is manipulation and constant manipulation is a killer of hair
          growth. <br> <br> Lay your edges and rock your natural hair but don't leave it
          out like that for too long. <br> <br> <strong>Changing hairstyles too often</strong> <br><br> This also
          boils down to manipulation. See sis, hair needs to be left alone to
          grow and thrive. Just leave your hair alone. Stop touching it
          unnecessarily. <br> <br> Don't make your hair and loosen it after a week. That
          is a whole lot of manipulation, first to make it and then to loosen
          it. The goal is to reduce manipulation to the very minimum so you see
          why this is counterproductive. <br> <br> There is no standard time for intervals
          between making your hair but a month is suitable and 2 weeks at
          minimum. If you can go more the better and of course, you can wash
          your hair without loosening it. <br> <br> The main point here is to LEAVE YOUR
          HAIR ALONE! <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br> <br> Your hair can and will grow if you give it some
          tender loving care. There is no such thing as permanent hair length
          and you can certainly achieve the hair goals you've always wanted if
          you would only stop making these mistakes.
