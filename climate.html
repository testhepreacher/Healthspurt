          Climate change will bankrupt us before it can ever end the world.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Climate change is a widespread topic in recent time and advocacy to
          curtail its effects is something that the average individual is aware
          of. <br />
          <br />

          It is a topic that has garnered lots of attention in the political
          space over the years. It is no news that with the discovery of coal
          more and more toxic chemicals are being released into the environment.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/climate-1.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Now the real arguments are: how should climate change be managed? who
          should be responsible for its management? and Is it a big enough
          concern to bother ourselves with in the first place? <br />
          <br />
          Activists like Greta Thunberg have become the face of climate change
          advocacy for liberals. Conservatives on the other hand are not having
          it and believe there are bigger problems to face. It has been a
          continuous tug fight. <br /><br />
          I would be breaking down as clearly as possible the true cost of
          climate change advocacy and how it will affect the quality of your
          life. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>How climate change advocacy affects energy politics.</strong>
          <br /><br />
          Climate change and energy politics go hand in hand. Industries around
          the world are in a constant struggle to decrease their use of fossil
          fuels and at the same time increase production. It is no easy feat.
          <br /><br />
          Nations like the US and China are expected to take responsibility for
          climate change as they have the majority of industries that produce
          most of the world's carbon print. <br /><br />
          The reactions of these nations have been quite interesting. The US has
          been actively trying to put policies in place to reduce its carbon
          print. Migration to cleaner energy sources and giving industries
          carbon limits have been the major moves and a net zero emission by
          2050 is the plan. <br /><br />
          China, on the other hand, although, first dismissive of climate change
          as a whole has also partaken in the cause. It is important to note
          that China is the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide. The
          country bids to bring its emissions to a peak by 2030 and be
          carbon-free by 2060. Its 3 Gorges dam is used for hydropower
          generation as part of the plan to reach its goal.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/climate-2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          However, due to droughts in recent times, these dams have been drying
          up. Construction of 8.6 gigawatts of coal power plants has been
          approved by Shanghai in the first quarter of this year as energy
          security trumps climate concerns. <br />
          <br />
          It is no news that China is at the forefront of the race to beat the
          US as the world's leading economy. China became the world's largest
          exporter of goods in 2009 with a contribution of 12.4% to global trade
          with the US close behind at 11% as of 2018. So trust that she will not
          cut down her fuel usage for an alternative that is not sustainable
          yet. <br /><br />
          Is it wise for the US to continue to pursue this very expensive
          endeavor even with the continuously rising inflation rates and
          increasing national debt while its competitors are gaining ground on
          it? <br /><br />
          <strong
            >Who suffers the most from climate change advocacy, the environment
            or you?</strong

          The way migration to renewable energy is being carried out, more harm
          may be caused than good. <br /><br />
          These things can't happen overnight. Green energy is first of all
          unsustainable. This is because its supply is greatly limited compared
          to coal and natural gas. Due to fluctuations in sunlight and wind
          energy, it is required that these renewable energies are stored in
          batteries which are themselves nonrenewable. This in itself is
          counter-productive.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/climate-3.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Also, taxpayers pay the cost of this migration. Yes, the already
          overworked middle/lower-class man and woman already dealing with
          inflation. The truth of the matter is beyond all the protests to
          reduce climate change, renewable energy is expensive and someone will
          have to pay for it. <br /><br />
          The Biden administration has increased corporate tax in the US to 21%.
          It claims that this increase will only affect big corporations. That
          is very false. What these cooperations do when there is a tax increase
          is simply to shift costs to the salaries of their employees who are
          the middle and lower class. They also shift costs to consumers by
          increasing the prices of their goods thereby further worsening
          inflation. <br /><br />
          An increase in poverty will naturally follow inflation. You may think
          "I'm African and these are issues that don't concern me" but
          developing nations will certainly also suffer from "cleaning the
          planet", maybe even more than others. Let's go into how. The
          industrial revolution was kicked off singularly with the discovery of
          coal, a cheap fuel compared to burning wood. Developed nations used
          coal, natural gas, and fossil fuels to grow their economy to where it
          is now. In the mid-2000s developing countries caught on and also began
          to grow their economy with fuel. Ironically, that is when the world
          discovered that this cheap gold is harming the environment.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/climate-4.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Millions of people in Africa face extreme poverty and hunger. Should
          this primary concern be abandoned for "cleaning the environment"? Only
          when people have food to eat and live comfortably will they care about
          the climate. Maybe concentrating on eradicating poverty will be a
          better idea oh you environmental empathizer. Maybe only then you can
          achieve your goal. <br /><br />
          Deloitte, the US main corporation that advocates for climate change in
          a recent publication admitted that migration to renewable energy will
          cause a reduction in economic growth for a short while. This "short
          while" is unspecified. <br /><br />
          The "temporary poverty" from green energy will be at the cost of those
          barely making it. <br /><br />
          Dutch farmer's protested earlier this year against the new emission
          rules enforced by their government to halve harmful emissions of
          nitrogen compounds by 2030. The government proposed a radical cut in
          livestock. They estimate that 11,200 farms will have to close and
          another 17,600 farmers will have to significantly reduce their
          livestock. Should the protection of the climate come at the cost of
          food production?
        </p>
        <img src="/images/climate-5.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          People are expected to believe that they should feel guilty for
          destroying the planet and should be happy to be made poorer to clean
          it even when they are already barely getting by and it simply doesn't
          make sense. <br /><br />
          <strong>The hypocrisy of climate change advocacy</strong> <br /><br />
          The 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference was held in
          November. The world leaders in attendance came to the venue, Egypt
          with private jets or some form of aircraft. It will interest you to
          know that a single private jet can emit 2 metric tons of carbon
          dioxide in just 1 hour. That is 2000kg of carbon dioxide. The jokes
          write themselves, don't they?
        </p>
        <img src="/images/climate-6.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Electric cars are supposed to be the better alternative to
          conventional cars to reduce carbon emissions. Although with initial
          high costs they are cheaper to maintain than conventional cars.
          However, the problem is, electric vehicles don't have zero emissions
          as we are made to believe . On average, they produce more than eight
          metric tons of CO2 in manufacturing and production plus an additional
          two metric tons of CO2 per year based on the energy mix used for
          electricity generation.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/climate-7.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          The production of lithium batteries for electric vehicles also comes
          with a host of environmental and human rights concerns: including
          child slavery, massive water usage, pollution, and more. <br /><br />
          Not only that, the wheels of electric cars have the same disastrous
          impacts as gas vehicles, the particulate matter also spreads through
          the environment killing fish and wildlife. <br /><br />
          The average comfortable person lives in a home with heating or
          air-conditioning depending on what part of the world he/she lives in,
          has home appliances like fridges, microwaves, etc, uses a mobile
          phone, and owns a car or uses some form of modern transportation to
          commute.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/climate-8.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          All these contribute to the pollution of the environment in one way or
          another other but they are technological advancements that have and
          continue to make our lives easier than that of the generation before
          us. <br><br> Who gets to determine what source of CO2 pollution should be
          tackled first? Should we begin with cars, gadgets, industrial
          machinery, or fertilizers amongst others? Or everything should be
          addressed at once? Transitioning to renewable energy across all
          industries at the same time without breaking the system is simply
          impossible. <br><br> Reasonable measures to reduce carbon emissions are
          encouraged but worse problems will arise when it becomes radical. With
          the explosion of woke activism and political correctness, it is
          becoming radical. <br><br> Hence, those that are convinced that climate change
          is so urgent a crisis that radical measures should be taken at the
          cost of making the whole world poorer should start getting rid of
          their gadgets and commuting by trekking. <br><br> As my favorite author, Jordan
          Peterson says: "Set your house in perfect order before you criticize
          the world". <br><br> <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br><br> Is it worth it to go on an endeavor that has a
          high probability of ruining us faster than climate change ever will? <br><br>
