        <h3>How to wash 4c hair without shrinkage | The ultimate guide</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          4C hair is the most common hair type among black people. Despite its
          amazing luscious curls, wash day can be a huge pain sometimes.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          Its hair strands are fragile and prone to shrinkage or shedding if not
          washed properly and with adequate precaution. Washing your hair like a
          pro without shrinking or shedding) is not difficult at all. You just
          need to follow some simple rules to set you on the right track. Let's
          walk through the dos and don't of wash day, shall we?
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Pre-poo(Pre-shampoo)</h5>
        <br />
        <p>
          This is what you do before washing your hair. Pre-pooing is important
          to prevent the shrinkage and toughness that comes with just-washed
          hair. The shrinkage is because of
          <strong>hygral fatigue</strong> which simply means overexposure of
          your hair strands to water. This makes your strands lose their
          elasticity and life causing them to shrink and (or) eventually break
          up.
          <br />
          <br />
          That being said, let's get to the gist of it. Pre-poo simply involves
          using penetrating oil to protect your hair from hygral fatigue before
          shampooing. This oil penetrates your scalp and strands and ensures
          they retain their strength. It does this by simply preventing too much
          water from entering the hair shaft which can damage the hair cuticles.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>The proper hair wash technique</h5>
        <p>
          First and foremost, comb out your hair before washing it. Use a
          Leave-in conditioner or water to soften it to make the process easier.
          A wide-toothed comb should be used and not a small-toothed comb. A
          small toothed comb will cut your hair in the process of detangling.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/hs-2.png" alt="" />
        <p>
          Your hair should be completely wet before applying shampoo. A basic
          rule is this; shampoo is for the scalp and conditioner is for the
          hair. More simply put shampoo is to be applied directly on your scalp
          and not on your hair.
          <br />
          <br />
          Yes, I know your hair is also dirty and needs to be cleaned too, but
          no need to be in a hurry, we are getting there. You see, shampoo
          concentration is too much for direct contact with your hair so it
          needs to be diluted.
          <br />
          <br />
          So what you do is squeeze some shampoo into your palm (too much is not
          necessary), rub your palms together and then rub against a section of
          your hair. Repeat till the shampoo goes around.
          <br />
          <br />
          Use your fingertips (not your nails!) to massage your scalp well. When
          you are satisfied with the wash(3 to 5 minutes should be enough) you
          then rinse off with warm water. You see, as the water washes down the
          shampoo from your scalp, it runs through your hair eventually,
          cleaning it in the process. You don't need to gather up your hair and
          wash it like you are washing clothes. That is rather unnecessary.
        </p>
        <br />

        <br />
        <p>
          With long and full hair, it is better to wash in sections. This will
          reduce the chances of tangling and allow easier access to the shampoo
          on your scalp. In fact, with long hair, it is better to do everything
          in sections, from combing to washing to moisturizing. This reduces the
          stress that comes with dealing with so much hair at the same time and
          makes your life easier.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="/images/hs-3.png" alt="" />
        <br />
        <p>
          Depending on the amount of product buildup(dirt) in your hair, you can
          wash it twice or thrice on your wash day. <br />
          It is important to note that how often you wash your hair also depends
          on the level of product build-up. Twice or once a month is ideal. More
          than that strips the hair of its natural oils and moisture. Some
          people wash their hair with only conditioner (co-wash). This is the
          same as not washing anything because the purpose of the conditioner is
          not to remove dirt.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Post-poo(conditioning)</h5>
        <br />
        <img src="/images/hs-4.png" alt="" />
        <br />
        <p>
          Like I said before, shampoo is for the scalp and conditioner is for
          the hair. Your scalp already secretes sebum to moisturize itself. Your
          hair(especially the ends) is more prone to dryness after washing.
          <br />
          Apply some conditioner to your hair and massage it properly. Make sure
          to concentrate on your ends. This prevents split ends. Afterward, wash
          it off with cold water to close up the hair cuticles containing
          moisture.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="/images/hs-5.png" alt="" />
        <br />
        <p>
          Asides from the rinse-out conditioner that comes with your shampoo,
          deep and leave-in conditioners should also be part of your wash day.
          <br />
          Deep conditioners are similar to rinse-out conditioners but give an
          extra boost of moisture. This is very useful, especially for
          low-porosity hair types that get dry faster. Hair Mayonnaise is a form
          of deep conditioner. <br />
          The process of applying it is similar to that of rinse-out
          conditioners with the difference being that it is left to stay for a
          longer time(30 mins). Remember, concentrate on your ends! Cover your
          conditioned hair up with a shower cap(or plastic bag if you don't have
          one). On top of that wrap a warm damp towel around your head. This
          will give your hair enough time to soak in the conditioner properly,
          maximizing moisture.
        </p>
        <br />
        <img src="/images/hs-6.png" alt="" />
        <br />
        <p>
          You also don't want to leave it in too long (several hours or
          overnight) so your cuticles don't swell up from too much moisture
          leaving your hair feeling limp and lifeless. This is hygral fatigue.
          Deep conditioning should be done once a month or 2 months and not too
          often. Remember, with hair care, too little or too much of anything is
          not good.
          <br />
          To remove excess water after washing, do not use a regular towel. The
          purpose of a regular towel is to dry your body (remove moisture). Why
          would you use it on your hair when the goal is to conserve that
          moisture? Airdrying or using a blow dryer on very low heat is
          appropriate.
          <br />
          As for the Leave-in conditioner, apply it as a final moisture provider
          and then seal it in with a protecting oil like shea butter or castor
          oil and you are good to go!
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>
          As opposed to popular belief, 4C hair doesn't have to be difficult to
          deal with. Once you know how to properly manage it, you'll find
          yourself falling more and more in love with your curls. Wash day will
          become a thing to look forward to when you apply all I have told you.
          Good luck!
