        <h2>Welcome to explore with Isla</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Islamiyya <br />

          I have always been fascinated by politics,social and economic topics
          from a very young age. Just fresh out of high school I would write on
          some trending political happening and post on my social media but I
          caught on early enough that most of my mates were not really
          interested. So I stuck to memes which seemed more "acceptable" or
          didn't post at all. Now, I have decided to embrace my inner self
          (whatever that means).
        </p>

          You have probably had this experience.There is this ground breaking
          news and different versions of the story are flying around the place
          and you don't know which is actually true. It is certainly frustrating
          and annoying, isn't it? Or maybe you just love a nice writeup about
          trending social issues,controversial topics and the likes and we all
          know the media is full of propaganda.
          <br> 
          <br>
           Well guess what? This right here
          is the space just for you!. Everything you read here is going to be
          properly researched. Come along with me on this journey as I explore
          the world with words and I mean it when I say that you my dear are in
          for a roller coaster ride.
